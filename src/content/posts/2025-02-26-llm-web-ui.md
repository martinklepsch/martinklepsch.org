After using Simon Willison's excellent [`llm` CLI tool](https://llm.datasette.io/) for a while, I found myself wanting a better way to browse through my conversation history. Terminal output is great for quick interactions, but finding that brilliant response from last week can be challenging.

That's why I built `llm-web-ui` - a simple browser interface for your LLM conversations.
## What is llm-web-ui?

`llm-web-ui` is a lightweight web interface that reads the conversation logs created by the `llm` CLI tool and presents them in a browser-friendly format. Under the hood, it reads directly from the SQLite database that `llm` uses to store conversations and presents that data through a React-based web interface - there's no separate database or sync mechanism needed. Launch it with a single command:

```bash
npx llm-web-ui "$(llm logs path)"
```

## Key Features

- **Conversation History**: Browse all your past conversations in a clean interface
- **Search**: Quickly find specific prompts or responses
- **Model Filtering**: Filter conversations by model
- **Token Usage Stats**: See detailed token usage information
- **Multi-turn Navigation**: Easily follow complex conversation flows

## Why I Built This

While using `llm`, I found myself missing some observability features:

1. Tracking which models I use most frequently
2. Finding previous solutions to similar problems
3. Analyzing my token efficiency

Rather than requesting these features be added to the core `llm` tool, I built a complementary tool that addresses these specific needs.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Using npx (no installation required)
npx llm-web-ui "$(llm logs path)"

# Or install globally
npm install -g llm-web-ui
llm-web-ui "$(llm logs path)"
```

The web interface will open automatically in your default browser.

If you find `llm-web-ui` useful, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/martinklepsch/llm-web-ui) and consider giving it a star to help others discover it!
