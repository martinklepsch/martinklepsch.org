After using Simon Willison's excellent [`llm` CLI tool](https://llm.datasette.io/) for a while, I found myself wanting a better way to browse through my conversation history. Terminal output is great for quick interactions, but finding anything again or reviewing it can be challenging.

That's why I built **`llm-web-ui`** - a simple browser interface for your LLM conversations.

## What is llm-web-ui?

It's a read-only web interface that gives you access to your `llm` logs database in a variety of ways. It's [open-source](https://github.com/martinklepsch/llm-web-ui) and contributions are welcome!

Launch it with a single command:

```bash
npx llm-web-ui "$(llm logs path)"
```

## Key Features

- **Conversation History**: all past conversations in a clean interface
- **Responses Stream**: all LLM interactions including token counts & cost

I'm planning to add usage stats as well. Once tagging is added to `llm` I'd like to add some filtering abilities as well.

## Why I Built This

While using `llm`, I found myself missing some observability features:

1. Tracking which models I use most frequently
2. Finding previous solutions to similar problems
3. Analyzing my token efficiency

Rather than requesting these features be added to the core `llm` tool, I built a complementary tool that addresses these specific needs.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Using npx (no installation required)
npx llm-web-ui "$(llm logs path)"

# Or install globally
npm install -g llm-web-ui
llm-web-ui "$(llm logs path)"
```

The web interface will open automatically in your default browser.

If you find `llm-web-ui` useful, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/martinklepsch/llm-web-ui) and consider giving it a star to help others discover it!
