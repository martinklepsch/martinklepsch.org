Around December 2011 the awesome crowd around Heroku released a [now open-source document](https://github.com/adamwiggins/12factor) that describes 12 factors that
build up a methodology of developing software-as-a-service products.

The main goals of [those 12 rules](http://www.12factor.net/) are:

* minimizing effort to board new developers
* maximizing portability
* encouraging continous deployment
* allowing to scale effortless

If you are developing a SaaS product this document will show you lots of ways to
improve your development practices. Fortunately it is not directly coupled to any specific
language or development environment (most tool examples are coming from Ruby, Python and Clojure
though) so that everyone will have something to take away.
