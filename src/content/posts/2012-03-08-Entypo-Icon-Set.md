There is not much more to add. Entypo covers many common icon use cases and the fact that it
ships with an OpenType font makes it even smoother to use.
I use a few icons here and there on this site and mainly prefer this icon set for its
cleanness and simplicity which allows you to easily integrate it into most designs.

<strike>Below you can see some of my favorites from the set. The cool thing about having it as
a font is also that you can change colors very easy.</strike> Deprecated the demo.
