My little "write a 100 things" project isn't really coming along all that well. Or maybe it's coming along well, but slowly. I could go full-on introspective now and carefully analyze what I'd need to do to produce more of these little random pieces but I also just came home from camping at a lake for 2 days so I'll defer that and take a hot shower instead. 

One thing I'm really enjoying though is the reactions I've been getting. Sometimes it's a conversation with a friend from the past, sometimes it's something new I haven't thought about. Oftentimes this happens on Twitter but, knowing myself, maybe there's more people who are willing to "reply" than those who chose do to so publicly on Twitter. 

So before I took off for the lake on Friday I did hack a little bit on *The Most Basic Comment Form* imaginable. You type, you hit enter. Done. The comment is then sent to me via [Pushover](https://pushover.net/). It's not stored and no one else will be able to see it. It's anonymous unless you add your name to the message.

It's an expansion of the existing feedback loop and I'm just very curious to see what will happen. Is the internet civil enough for an anonymous comment form? ðŸ™ƒ
