This is inspired by a bunch of Twitter strangers putting things like &quot;(22/100 Youtube videos)&quot; next to their display names and by <a href="https://critter.blog/">Mike</a> who has been blogging every day for the last 100+ days, producing a wonderful array of short but insightful articles.</p><p>Doing anything a hundred times should give me a good understanding of what I like or dislike about it. It'll also require that I keep an open eye for topics and themes to write about. Being a more attentive observer. Reviewing notes and bookmarks on the hunt for the next bit. </p><p>I've also observed that a lot of writing I enjoy has a certain conviction to it. Writers like <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visakan</a> come to mind. They share their ideas without much introduction or &quot;proof&quot;, and yet a lot of their writing really resonates with me as being true to my subjective experience. </p><p>In the process of writing more regularly I will also write shorter posts, share more unfinished ideas, mid-flight thoughts and random ramblings. Part of this experiment is to get rid of the filter I've created for myself for posting on my <a href="https://martinklepsch.org">main blog</a> and just write more for the sake of writing — and sharing. </p><p>If there's things you'd like to see me write about, let me know!</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">1 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
