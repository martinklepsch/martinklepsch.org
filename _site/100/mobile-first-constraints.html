It's a very short and sweet book, like many others by <a href="https://abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a>. The book argues that web experiences should be designed for mobile first for two main reasons: </p><ol><li>mobile is growing like hell and</li><li>starting with a more constrained design leads to a better understanding of the core of what is being built.</li></ol><p>The case for mobile growing is supported by engagement and screen time metrics with a kind of blissful ignorance for more recent addiction concerns that you can probably only find in a 2015 book.</p><p>Anyways, that second point is what stayed with me and what I've been thinking about a lot in the context of my own work. Designing for mobile first, forces a product team to discover the essence of a feature that is being developed. It becomes about identifying the smallest useful thing to ship. </p><p>If you think about it there aren't any quite as easy-to-articulate constraints to be a forcing function. Most of the reduction happening in the product development process is based on intuition, subjective experience and user interviews. Designing for a small screen first on the other hand is an incredibly specific guideline.</p><p>It also reinforces all the things I want when working on product stuff: learning from experiments as early as possible and shipping fast / building momentum.</p><p>To end this, here's a nice quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/katearonowitz">Kate Aronowitz</a>, back then Facebook’s Director of Design:</p><blockquote><p> We’re just now starting to get into mobile first and then web second for a lot of our products. What we’re finding is that the designers on mobile are really embracing the constraints [and] that it’s actually teaching us a lot about how to design back to the desktop, </p></blockquote></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">2 / 100</a></div><div class="my3 max-width-2 mx-auto"><input id="feedback-input" placeholder="have something to say?" style="width:80%;color:var(--text);background-color:var(--bg);padding:8px;border-radius:3px;border:1px solid var(--link);"><script src="https://comments-321314.web.app/cmts.js"></script><script>setupInput(document.getElementById("feedback-input"))</script></div></div></body></html>
