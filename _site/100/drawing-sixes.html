He paints the digit '6' on all kinds of crap that you can find on the street. He paints it pretty much exclusively on things that will disappear again. Trash, poster ads, giveaway boxes, you name it. </p><p>I've been a spectator of this for quite some time now, spotting a new six here and there. For a long time I've been very curious about who is behind this. Sometimes I'd see a new six and the paint would still be wet. Then, one time, I even saw him paint a six just a few hundred meters from my home — but I was rushed and didn't stop. </p><p>Ultimately there were some other hints and I found out who he was.</p><p>There's a <strong>14 year old video</strong> <a href="https://www.are.na/block/12120615">on Vimeo</a> where he talks about his art. Part of the reason for choosing a simple shape like '6' was so that he could draw it while riding his bike. </p><p><img alt="guy painting a 6 from the bike" src="/images/uploads/bike-6.jpg" title="guy painting a 6 from the bike"></p><p>He also makes strange software for keyboard shortcuts on Windows that I don't understand at all.</p><p>And here I am, struggling to write 100 things. He probably drew tens of thousands of sixes over the years. Even without understanding the motivation, the persistence behind this project is inspiring. </p><p>I compiled a <a href="https://www.are.na/martin-klepsch/nk6">collection of images and links on Are.na</a>.</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">13 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
