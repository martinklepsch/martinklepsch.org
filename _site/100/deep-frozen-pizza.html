Maybe it's Sunday, the fridge is empty and you're not really feeling like Sushi or Indian. You're craving the carbs of a nice pizza. Unfortunately almost all the time I'd be disappointed by my decision. Pizza that is in a delivery box for anything between 10-30 minutes just can't be the same as one that's fresh out of the oven. You all know what I'm talking about. </p><p>So, the thoughtleader that I am, I hereby proclaim that you shall not order pizza but instead buy frozen pizza. Don't buy anything other than the ones by <a href="https://gustavo-gusto.de/pizzen/">Gustavo Gusto</a>. They are gooood. 🍕 👌</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UnAbszcy3bs" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">11 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
