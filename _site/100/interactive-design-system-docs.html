Storybook is great but it's also <a href="https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/">so intertwined with build tools</a> that it's not really fun to target from ClojureScript. I know some people are doing it but they didn't seem too excited about it. </p><p>We ended up just making yet another component which shows all our components. It's basic but it's good enough for our current needs. </p><p>Now recently there's been quite a lot of interesting things happening around the <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/sci">small clojure interpreter (sci)</a>, which made me wonder if maybe it could also be used as tool to provide interactive design system / component documentation. </p><p>And... it looks like it could be quite nice. <code>sci</code> makes it very easy to access any function in your ClojureScript code and after that you don't need much more than a small textarea with an example of using the component and a place to render it.</p><p>With a bit more work you could probably colocate the examples with the component via macros or metadata. Another macro could be used to fully expose specific namespaces.</p><p>Seems nice? </p><pre><code>(rum/defc Button &lt; rum/static
  [attrs label]
  [:button attrs label])

(rum/defc ComponentViewer &lt; rum/static
  []
  (let [[input set-input!] (rum/use-state &quot;(ui/Button {:on-click #(js/alert :hello)} \&quot;hello\&quot;)&quot;)
        [c set-c!] (rum/use-state nil)]
    (rum/use-effect!
     (fn []
       (set-c!
        (sci/eval-string input
                         {:classes {'js goog/global :allow :all}
                          ;; make the Button component available
                          :namespaces {'ui {'Button Button}}})))
     [input])
    [:div
