Or maybe it's coming along well, but slowly. I could go full-on introspective now and carefully analyze what I'd need to do to produce more of these little random pieces but I also just came home from camping at a lake for 2 days so I'll defer that and take a hot shower instead. </p><p>One thing I'm really enjoying though is the reactions I've been getting. Sometimes it's a conversation with a friend from the past, sometimes it's something new I haven't thought about. Oftentimes this happens on Twitter but, knowing myself, maybe there's more people who are willing to &quot;reply&quot; than those who chose do to so publicly on Twitter. </p><p>So before I took off for the lake on Friday I did hack a little bit on <em>The Most Basic Comment Form</em> imaginable. You type, you hit enter. Done. The comment is then sent to me via <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a>. It's not stored and no one else will be able to see it. It's anonymous unless you add your name to the message.</p><p>It's an expansion of the existing feedback loop and I'm just very curious to see what will happen. Is the internet civil enough for an anonymous comment form? ðŸ™ƒ</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">14 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
