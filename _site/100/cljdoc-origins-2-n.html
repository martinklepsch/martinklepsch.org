Back to January 2018. As <a href="https://martinklepsch.org/100/cljdoc-origins-1-n.html">I said</a> I created a <a href="https://clojureverse.org/uploads/default/original/1X/3ecba3a15c85783f14044da7b8be57020304ecce.pdf">small presentation</a> and shared it, full of excitement, with the attendees of that January Clojure Berlin meetup. At the time I had a prototype that analyzed a jar, and created a super basic page listing vars in the available namespaces.</p><p><img alt="The very first namespace with some vars being listed " src="https://martinklepsch.org/images/uploads/screen-shot-2018-01-11-at-22.31.01.png" title="cljdoc v0"></p><p>At that time I had maybe sunk a dozen hours or so into this project. I was so excited. So excited to just share the vision of the project but also quite excited to potentially recruit some people to join me.</p><p>I don't remember all the interactions I had after that meetup but I do remember one.</p><p>One of the core problems of this project was always to analyze Clojure code without opening up a bunch of security holes. Anything can happen when requiring a Clojure namespace. There's no guarantee that it won't start deleting random files or mining bitcoin.</p><p>At that January meetup I didn't yet have a good answer for this problem and basically asked the room if they had ideas or might even be able to help with this directly.</p><p>And then there was this one person. I was being informed how very difficult this is and that there's companies whose whole business builds around detecting abuse like this. What I was trying to do was basically a futile effort. Not the greatest vibe when you're sharing an early idea but — surprisingly — it did kind of work out for me in the end.</p><p>In the coming days I was all about just finding a way to be able to say: &quot;Look, the impossible just happened!&quot;</p><p>A twisted part of me just wanted to prove to that person that they're not going to shoot this down. And you know, probably it wasn't even their intention.</p><p>As you might guess I didn't magically solve all the problems. But I found a kind of hack that just avoided the problem all together. I used CircleCI's build infrastructure, queued jobs with different parameters via their API and collected the results as a file that was stored with the build as a build artifact. <a href="https://cljdoc.org/builds">40.000+ builds later</a> this is still going strong as ever.</p><p>After figuring this out it felt like the rest was within the boundaries of what I've done in the past. Even though I've only been hacking on this for a couple of weeks it felt like the rest would be like riding down a hill. It turned out to be a pretty long slope but I think I didn't quite realize that at this point.</p><p>Anyways, time to call it a night and get some food. Take care of yourselves ☺️</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">5 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
