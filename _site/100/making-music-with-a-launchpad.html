Synthesizers make this fun, all the lack of musical knowledge you can make up for with knowledge of twisting knobs.</p><p>I bought a used microKORG and had some fun with that, started to try to find my way through the piano keys. Sitting down to practice doesn't come very easy for me though. My best learning &quot;journeys&quot; happen when I'm chasing new knowledge and immediately apply it. Practicing is kind of the opposite, or at least it feels that way to me. </p><p>And because of that I never really got comfortable on piano keys. </p><p>My most recent attempt to be able to make music is a Launchpad X. These midi controllers have an 8x8 grid and a layout with which you can play notes using that grid. What's great about this layout is that it is &quot;isomorphic&quot;: </p><blockquote><p> 'Isomorphic' controllers are designed so that scales and chords use the same shapes in any key.  </p></blockquote><p>Having the ability to switch between scales and modes without losing all of your muscle memory seems great. I also find it easier to move my hands over the square than over the width of a piano. </p><p>Sure, it's not the same but do I really care? I just want to make something that sounds nice.</p><p>I've also been taking some lessons with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwDrJn9Jzqaz8fy20EenQFA">Jamie Blake</a>, who just has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cRau38tu4">beautiful way</a> of playing his Ableton Push 2 (which is similar to my Launchpad in that it is an isomorphic controller). </p><p>Anyone else playing around with this?</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">9 / 100</a></div><div class="my3 max-width-2 mx-auto"><input id="feedback-input" placeholder="have something to say?" style="width:80%;color:var(--text);background-color:var(--bg);padding:8px;border-radius:3px;border:1px solid var(--link);"><script src="https://comments-321314.web.app/cmts.js"></script><script>setupInput(document.getElementById("feedback-input"))</script></div></div></body></html>
