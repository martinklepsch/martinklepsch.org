You can read <a href="https://lu.ma/p/MnWMR5rLJHDcWL5/Martin-says-Welcome">the first edition here</a> and it's also in full below. Since I started this project here of writing 100 things I decided to be generous with myself and I'll also count any newsletters I'm sending. </p></blockquote><p>Hello and welcome dear friends,</p><p>you probably subscribed to this list about a month ago when <a href="https://twitter.com/martinklepsch/status/1428333611992993795">I mentioned on Twitter</a> that I'd like to do a stream during which I try to build and ship a small ClojureScript app including a backend and database. Time has come: I'll stream this on Twitch next Tuesday 11AM Berlin time. You can register for it <a href="https://lu.ma/hackers-cljs">here</a>.</p><p>What follows is a random assortment of things™</p><h2>Subscription layers (and time)</h2><p>I've been thinking about subscription layers in frontend apps quite a bit. In an earlier library of mine (<a href="https://github.com/martinklepsch/derivatives">derivatives</a>) I essentially followed a &quot;watch-based approach&quot;, meaning a &quot;derivative&quot; would recompute whenever any of it's inputs change. Now in the projects I work on the changes or often much more granular and suitable for a more reduce-based approach that processes individual change events.</p><p>This reduce-based approach is something I'm intending to explore more.</p><p>Another interesting challenge I've come across is that sometimes I have an entity with a state like <code>active?</code> that really depends on the current time. Most subscription layers don't really expose anything to ensure that the subscription is recomputed the moment <code>active? </code>should change. The best idea I have right now is to schedule a &quot;touch&quot; event that forces a rebuild of the subscription but I haven't really explored an implementation of that yet.</p><h2>Cycle time</h2><p>Yesterday I listened to <a href="https://www.therepl.net/episodes/40/">The REPL with Paulus Esterhazy</a> and it made me once again aware of the importance of cycle time in software development. One of the core metrics Paulus mentions is the time between first commit on a feature branch to production deploy.</p><p>A lot of the conversation reminded me of <a href="https://www.notion.so/rostnl/Systems-Thinking-Notes-Resources-2871c456284b47388b7a76d47521038c#2c3b8ac9282848f9b5506134c38202d9">Theory of Constraints</a> (some notes by Robert Stuttaford) and how to optimize for throughput you have to tackle bottlenecks first.</p><p>I'm hoping that over the next months I can explore this some more and put some metrics in place for the product team at <a href="https://gatheround.com/">Gatheround</a>.</p><h2>Retrospectives</h2><p>Through the above podcast I also discovered the podcast by GeePaw Hill and in particular the one about how for retrospectives, <a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/08/04/retrospectives-variety-is-key/">variety is key</a>. I've been running <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqtxMy58kz8">POPCORN Flow</a>-inspired retros with our engineering team for a while now but I'm occasionally missing a bit of energy in the room (zoom) and so this podcast was a welcome invitation to experiment with more different format and cycle hosts.</p><blockquote><p> The goal here: decenter ourselves just the right amount for dynamic, creative discourse about who &amp; how we were — and who &amp; how we wish to be. </p></blockquote><h2>Can trees talk?</h2><p>Last but not least a video by the amazing Real Science YouTube channel about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HiADisBfQ0">how trees communicate using fungal networks</a>. It goes into the details behind various experiments that were used to prove that some information flow is happening between trees.</p><p>In one of the experiments one of three plants was infected with a pest and the two other started producing enzymes to defend against the pest within 6 hours. But check it out yourself, it's pretty cool!</p><p>Ok, that's it. Happy Friday y'all.</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">19 / 100</a></div><div class="my3 max-width-2 mx-auto"><input id="feedback-input" placeholder="have something to say?" style="width:80%;color:var(--text);background-color:var(--bg);padding:8px;border-radius:3px;border:1px solid var(--link);"><script src="https://comments-321314.web.app/cmts.js"></script><script>setupInput(document.getElementById("feedback-input"))</script></div></div></body></html>
