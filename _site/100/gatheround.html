Now I work for a company called <a href="https://gatheround.com">Gatheround</a>. After months of behind the scenes work we finally changed our name to something a little more open. Something that better reflects the ambitions behind the product. </p><p>Some time last year we started with a list of a dozen or so names. And here we are today.</p><p><a href="https://gatheround.com"><img alt="screenshot of the Gatheround homepage" src="/images/uploads/gatheround-homepage-screenshot.png" title="Gatheround"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.brennajmarketello.com/">Brenna</a> came up with a wonderful design system which I got to pour in code. Prior to this rebrand we didn't have much of a design system so having one now is already paying huge dividends in terms of shipping more consistent interfaces.</p><p><strong>The migration</strong> was also a fun challenge to tackle. In the end we back-ported some of our new design system to the old Icebreaker brand and used a feature flag whenever that didn't feel appropriate. This approach meant we didn't need to feature-freeze at all and that we would preserve the Git history of our UI code. </p><p>We also allowed enabling the feature flag via a URL param which meant that others on the team could review the new brand in preview environments.</p><p>Last but not least I had quite a bit of fun getting into <a href="https://react-spring.io/">react-spring</a> for some <strong>animations</strong> on the <a href="https://gatheround.com">homepage</a>. It's been a few years that I seriously looked at React animation stuff and it seems to have come a long way since then. The hooks-based react-spring API is pretty straightforward and since everything happens inside your program (as opposed to CSS transitions) you have much more direct control over sequencing and overall behavior.</p><p>CSS-in-JS was also something that might have made some things easier (e.g. parameterizing styles, avoiding conflicts) but ultimately it felt a little too risky given that no-one on the team had significant experience using it. </p><p>Shout out to everyone who helped make this happen including the many open source projects that we rely on.
