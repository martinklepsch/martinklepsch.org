I wrote almost <a href="https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/tree/master/doc/adr">two dozen Architecture Decision Records</a> (ADR) hoping it would help future contributors navigate the codebase. I encouraged people to contribute and tried to spec out smaller &quot;good first issue&quot; type contributions so folks could start with something small. </p><p>Once people started contributing I of course wanted to encourage them to stick around and help maintain the project. Since there's so many parts to maintaining a project like this even small non-code contributions like participating in a discussion or reviewing a PR can be tremendously helpful. </p><p>To give a sense of ownership I added anyone who contributed as a contributor on GitHub and gave them push access to the repository. The understanding was that we'd still use PRs for most contributions but it did remove me as a primary gatekeeper. Any previous contributor is empowered merge a PR. I think the first time I read about this approach as in Felix GeisendÃ¶rfers <a href="https://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack/">Pull Request Hack</a> article. </p><p>As the project grew we added continuous deployment. Any commits to the main branch are automatically deployed. It might seem a bit wild to just let anyone deploy to cljdoc.org but it works for this project.</p><p>cljdoc isn't a library. It doesn't have an API. We can just let people improve it in ways they see fit. Sure maintainability is still a concern, but that is much less challenging than maintaining backwards compatible APIs or just designing a good API in the first place. Historically I think most contributions have actually improved the codebase.</p><p>I'm really happy I'm not maintaining a popular library with lots of contributors. I'm helping maintain a thing where people can play around and explore their ideas. Where it's ok to make a mistake. We're all here to learn. I learned so much from creating cljdoc and I couldn't be happier that others can do the same. </p><p>Shoutout to Lee Read who prompted these reflections. ðŸ™Œ</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">16 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
