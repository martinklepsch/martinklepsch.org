Sometimes that results in choices that might be hard to understand from the outside. Clojure is a programming language that even many programmers I meet haven't heard of. Vim is a text editor that requires years of building muscle memory to really feel that extra power it gets you.</p><p>With both of these there are fundamental differences to their alternatives that seemed worthwhile at the time and still do. Clojure provides a feedback loop like no other language I've used. Vim just helps me looking like &quot;a guy who knows things&quot; in front of my coworkers. We all know it matters.</p><p>Anyways, I care about tools.</p><p>I believe the tools we use shape how we work in subtle, yet significant ways. I hope you agree that the logical conclusion to this is that we should always question the tools we use. Do they serve us well? Are they a reflection of how we want to work? How we want to collaborate? Do they feel like a sharp knife or more like a dull one?</p><p>I've been thinking about this in the context of my own tool-use. I'm writing this in Roam, an app that feels a bit like Vim. It almost looks broken the first few times you look at it but there's something at a lower level that I agree with and for which I'm willing to feel lost every now and then.</p><p>As a software engineer I use plenty of &quot;tools&quot; every day. Some of my own choosing, some chosen by the group of people I work with. There are certain defaults. Google Docs, Trello, GitHub, Asana &amp;c.</p><p>I'm writing this because I think it is important to question those defaults. Try new things. Find tools that spark joy and don't underestimate the second order effects of having sharp knives in your kitchen.</p><p><a href="https://martinklepsch.org/posts/when-we-build-stuff.html">“We shape our tools and our tools shape us.”</a> — Marshall McLuhan</p></section><div class="my3"><a href="/100/writing-100-things.html">12 / 100</a></div></div></body></html>
