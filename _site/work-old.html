            in need of a capable developer-design-hybrid for your project, look
            no further. I'm making internet professionally since 2010 with my
            position always being somewhere between developer and designer.
            Since mid 2014 I'm mostly focusing on Clojure(Script) based projects
            and support companies adopt Clojure(Script) and evolve existing
            systems
          </p>
          <p>Some recent projects I've been involved with:</p>
          <h3><a href="#enerkeep" id="enerkeep"></a>Enerkeep</h3>
          <p>
            If you are the owner of a photovoltaic system selling your energy to
            the grid has made you good returns due to government incentives. As
            PV systems become cheaper these incentives will be reduced and it
            becomes more economic to consume your energy yourself. To do that
            you need a battery but choosing one is a complex task. Enerkeep
            helps consumers find the right battery and get it installed.
          </p>
          <p>My involvement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created a ClojureScript application that helps selecting a suited
              battery and integrated it into the site.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set up a continous integration pipeline that greatly reduced the
              effort of deploying new builds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revised design and it's implementation that has been created by an
              external agency.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Before coming to Berlin in October 2010 I mostly worked for smaller
            companies and NGOs. While my work is now mostly defined by
            programming I did a lot of design work then.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside some
            <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Fun-Relax-Chair/214211"
              >fun work</a
            >
            I did for my own I also designed a companies corporate identity and
            a lot of
            <a
              href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Bibernelle-Newspaper-Ad/212182"
              >print adverts</a
            >
            for them. When some people I knew decided to create a new label for
            high quality music and dance events they asked me to design their
            <a
              href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Noblenights-Unplugged-Bar-/364199"
              >promotional material</a
            >
            and logo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doing design work I mostly focus on typography and to provide the
            most important information in the most accessible way possible.
          </p>

            <p>A good test suite matters</p>
          </blockquote>

            My first gig in Berlin was quite random. After applying for and
            joining a <a href="http://cct-ev.de">local junior enterprise</a> (a
            consultancy led by students) I was invited by one of my tech
            colleagues to work at his startup. So I started working at
            <a href="http://pokerboni.com">Pokerboni.com</a> with Ruby on Rails
            without knowing much more than the underlying concepts. I learned a
            lot about the basics of application development with Rails there.
          </p>
          <p>
            After half a year I decided to move on and eventually found
            something great with <a href="http://madvertise.com">madvertise</a>.
            Their application architecture and business goals were by far more
            complicated than the ones I encountered earlier. What I am taking
            away from my stay at madvertise is that a good continuous
            integration/testing setup is worth a lot and that awareness of
            certain tools is important when working in teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now I am looking for the <em>next</em> so don't hesitate to
            contact me. (May '12)
