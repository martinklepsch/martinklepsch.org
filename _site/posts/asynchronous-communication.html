            <p>
              Communication is a central part of working in teams. I believe
              having asynchronous communication channels and making heavy use of
              them can have great effects on productivity, transparency and
              therefore happiness and fun within teams. Here are a few reasons
              why.
            </p>
            <h2>Interruptions</h2>
            <p>
              There are
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/25multi.html"
                >dozens of studies</a
              >
              about the consequences of being interrupted while performing
              demanding tasks. They usually suggest that it takes a human around
              20 minutes to get back into the state they have been in prior to
              the interruption. As if this wouldn't be enough it also increases
              the chances of making mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              While a chatroom doesn't necessarily removes interruptions all at
              once it allows everyone to react to an interruption at will. If
              you really want no interruption for a certain period of time you
              can easily turn off all notifications. Not reacting to the waving
              hands of a coworker is quite a bit harder (and not very polite as
              well).
            </p>
            <h2>Transparency</h2>
            <p>
              Transparency is a great thing. I strongly believe an absolutistic
              approach to transparency is the only way to go nowadays.
              Transparency helps to identify bad decisions early on and
              increases acceptance of decisions by keeping everyone in the loop.
              Companies like
              <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/email-transparency">Stripe</a>
              are doing an excellent job at advocating this approach. I could go
              into lengths about how important this is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Achieving this level of transparency with meetings and written
              reports is very time consuming if not impossible at all.
              Channeling most communication through asynchronous communication
              channels allows other people to passively follow along and saves a
              bunch of time that would otherwise have been spent in inefficient
              meetings.
            </p>
            <h2>Written Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Think before you speak. That's what they say. Problem is that this
              is quite hard in a fast paced environment like meetings. Just
              taking 5 minutes to order your thoughts isn't something people
              usually do there. Instead they talk. Written communication forces
              you to get to the point in a way that everyone can follow and at
              the same time allows you to refine your own understanding of the
              problem.
            </p>
            <h2>Tool Integration</h2>
            <p>
              Most of the team chat things you'll find provide integrations with
              your existing toolchain. It's easy to setup a bot that notifies
              you about breaking builds, new commits, errors on your platform or
              whatever else. Integrating this kind of information into your
              communication channels allows better collaboration on it and also
              increases visibility of what people are working on (=
              transparency).
            </p>
            <h2>Logging</h2>
            <p>
              In my experience things are often discussed in passing and
              sometimes even decisions are made in these situations. A week
              later when you actually find the time to implement the things
              decided back then they seem stupid and you are not able to
              actually retrieve the reasoning behind them from the back of your
              head. Having in place the infrastructure to quickly discuss
              something without setting up a meeting is a great way to avoid
              this kind of decision making and also allows you to trace back
              past discussions if a decision is being questioned.
            </p>
            <h2>Location-independent Productivity</h2>
            <p>
              Channeling most conversation through chat rooms makes team members
              less dependent on being geographically close to each other. (I'm
              not expanding on this as I think removing a dependency is always a
              good thing.)
            </p>
            <h2>Closing Remarks &amp; Further Reading</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a strong believer when it comes to asynchronous communication
              and I hope this list provides a good overview about the main
              reasons why it's a good approach to internal communication.
