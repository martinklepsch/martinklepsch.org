              After moving to Berlin I kind of failed to continue some regular
              sports activity. This is two years ago now. Today I'm going to
              change that.
            </p>
            <p>Today I'm starting to run.</p>
            <h2>Why Running</h2>
            <p>
              The answer is as simple as it gets: because it can be done
              everywhere at any time and without any organizational effort such
              as finding a partner for going climbing, which I did back then in
              my old hometown.
            </p>
            <h2>Running a Marathon</h2>
            <p>
              To stay motivated in the long term I decided it would be nice to
              set some goal to achieve and what else could that be beside
              running a marathon? There is not much coming to my mind. So
              starting today I'm training to run a marathon in about six months.
              I don't know which marathon yet unfortunately, especially since
              the
              <a href="http://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/">Berlin marathon</a
              >’s registration is closed already.
            </p>
            <p>
              My training schedule isn’t finished yet but for the first month
              I’m planning to run at least
              <a href="http://www.runmap.net/route/437129">3 days a week</a> at
              an average distance of six kilometers. I hope to run longer
              distances irregularly as soon as possible as well.
            </p>
            <p>Today is Day One.</p>
