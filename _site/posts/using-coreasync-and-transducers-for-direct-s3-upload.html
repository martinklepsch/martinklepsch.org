            Using core.async and Transducers to upload files from the browser to
            S3
          </h1>
          <section class="mkdwn lh-copy">
            <p>
              In a project I'm working on we needed to enable users to upload
              media content. In many scenarios it makes sense to upload to S3
              directly from the browser instead of routing it through a server.
              If you're hosting on Heroku you need to do this anyways. After
              digging a bit into
              <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async"
                ><code>core.async</code></a
              >
              this seemed like a neat little excuse to give Clojure's new
              transducers a go.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="#the-problem" id="the-problem"></a>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
              To upload files directly to S3 without any server in between you
              need to do a couple of things:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your bucket
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide special parameters in the request that authorize the
                upload
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Enabling CORS is fairly straightforward, just follow
              <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html"
                >the documentation</a
              >
              provided by AWS. The aforementioned special parameters are based
              on your AWS credentials, the key you want to save the file to,
              it's content-type and
              <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1434/"
                >a few other things</a
              >. Because you don't want to store your credentials in client-side
              code the parameters need to be computed on a server.
            </p>
            <p>
              We end up with the following procedure to upload a file to S3:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get a Javascript File object from the user</li>
              <li>Retrieve special parameters for post request from server</li>
              <li>Post <strong>directly from the browser</strong> to S3</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>
              <a href="#server-side-code" id="server-side-code"></a>Server-side
              code
            </h2>
            <p>

                >some rough Clojure code</a
              >
              illustrating the construction of the special parameters and how
              they're sent to the client.
            </p>

              <a
                href="#client-side-transducers-and-coreasync"
                id="client-side-transducers-and-coreasync"
              ></a
              >Client-side: Transducers and core.async
            </h2>
            <p>
              As we see the process involves multiple asynchronous steps:
              <img src="/images/s3-direct.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>
              To wrap all that up into a useful minimal API that hides all the
              complex back and forth happening until a file is uploaded
              core.async channels and transducers turned out very useful:
            </p>
            <pre><code>(defn s3-upload [report-chan]
  (let [upload-files (map #(upload-file % report-chan))
        upload-chan  (chan 10 upload-files)
        sign-files   (map #(sign-file % upload-chan))
        signing-chan (chan 10 sign-files)]

    (go (while true
          (let [[v ch] (alts! [signing-chan upload-chan])]
            ; that's not really required but has been useful
            (log v))))
    signing-chan))
</code></pre>
            <p>
              This function takes one channel as argument where it will
              <code>put!</code> the result of the S3 request. You can take a
              look at the <code>upload-file</code> and
              <code>sign-file</code> functions
              <a
                href="https://gist.github.com/martinklepsch/96e548d9595e111d70ce"
                >in this gist</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>So what's happening here?</strong> We use a channel for
              each step of the process: <code>signing-chan</code> and
              <code>upload-chan</code>. Both of those channels have an
              associated transducer. In this case you can think best of a
              transducer as a function that's applied to each item in a channel
              on it's way through the channel. I initially trapped upon the fact
              that the transducing function is only applied when the element is
              being taken from the channel as well. Just putting things into a
              channel doesn't trigger the execution of the transducing function.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>signing-chan</code>'s transducer initiates the request to
              sign the File object that has been put into the channel. The
              second argument to the <code>sign-file</code> function is a
              channel where the AJAX callback will put it's result. Similary
              <code>upload-chan</code>'s transducer initiates the upload to S3
              based on information that has been put into the channel. A
              callback will then put S3's response into the supplied
              <code>report-chan</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last line returns the channel that can be used to initiate a
              new upload.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="#using-this" id="using-this"></a>Using this</h2>
            <p>
              Putting this into a library and opening it up for other people to
              use isn't overly complicated, the exposed API is actually very
              simple. Imagine an
              <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a> component
              <code>upload-form</code>:
            </p>
            <pre><code>(defn queue-file [e owner {:keys [upload-queue]}]
  (put! upload-queue (first (array-seq (.. e -target -files)))))

(defcomponent upload-form [text owner]
  (init-state [_]
    (let [rc (chan 10)]
      {:upload-queue (s3-upload rc)
       :report-chan rc}))
  (did-mount [_]
    (let [{:keys [report-chan]} (om/get-state owner)]
      (go (while true (log (&lt;! report-chan))))))
  (render-state [this state]
    (dom/form
     (dom/input {:type &quot;file&quot; :name &quot;file&quot;
                 :on-change #(queue-file % owner state)} nil))))
</code></pre>
            <p>
              I really like how simple this is. You put a file into a channel
              and whenever it's done you take the result from another channel.
              <code>s3-upload</code> could take additional options like logging
              functions or a custom URL to retrieve the special parameters
              required to authorize the request to S3.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has been the first time I've been doing something useful with
              core.async and, probably less surprisingly, the first time I
              played with transducers. I assume many things can be done better
              and I still need to look into some things like how to properly
              shut down the <code>go</code> blocks.

              code he wrote that did similar things and to Kevin Downey
              (<em>hiredman</em>) who helped me understand core.async and
              transducers by answering my stupid questions in
              <code>#clojure</code> on Freenode.
