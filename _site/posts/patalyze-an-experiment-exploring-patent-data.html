            <p>
              For a few months now I've been working on and off on a little
              &quot;data-project&quot; analyzing patents published by the US
              Patent &amp; Trademark Office. Looking at the time I spent on this
              until now I think I should start talking about it instead of just
              hacking away evening after evening.
            </p>
            <p>
              It started with a simple observation: there are companies like
              Apple that sometimes collaborate with smaller companies building a
              small part of Apple's next device. A contract like this usually
              gives the stock of the small company a significant boost. What if
              you could foresee those relationships by finding patents that
              employees from Apple and from the small company filed?
            </p>
            <h2>
              <a href="#an-api-for-patent-data" id="an-api-for-patent-data"></a
              >An API for patent data?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Obviously this isn't going to change the world for the better but
              just the possibility that such predictions or at least indications
              are possible kept me curious to look out for APIs offering patent
              data. I did not find much. So thinking about something small that
              could be &quot;delivered&quot; I thought a patent API would be
              great. To build the dataset I'd parse the archives provided on
              Google's
              <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/uspto-patents.html"
                >USPTO Bulk downloads</a
              >
              page.
            </p>
            <p>
              I later found out about <a href="http://enigma.io">Enigma</a> and
              some offerings by
              <a href="http://ip.thomsonreuters.com">Thomson Reuters</a>. The
              prices are high and the sort of analysis we wanted to do would
              have been hard with inflexible query APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              For what we wanted to do we only required a small subset of the
              data a patent contains. We needed the organization, it's authors,
              the title and description, filing- and publication dates and some
              identifiers. With such a reduced amount of data that's almost only
              useful in combination with the complete data set I discarded the
              plan to build an API. Maybe it will make sense to publish reduced
              and more easily parseable versions of the archives Google provides
              at some point. Let me know if you would be interested in that.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="#whats-next" id="whats-next"></a>What's next</h2>
            <p>
              So far I've built up a system to parse, store and query some 4
              million patents that have been filed at the USPTO since beginning
              of 2001. While it sure would be great to make some money off of
              the work I've done so far I'm not sure what product could be built
              from the technology I created so far. Maybe I could sell the
              dataset but the number of potential customers is probably small
              and in general I'd much more prefer to make it public. I'll
              continue to explore the possibilities with regards to that.
            </p>
            <p>
              For now I want to explore the data and share the results of this
              exploration. I setup a small site that I'd like to use as home for
              any further work on this. By now it only has a newsletter signup
              form (just like any other landing page) but I hope to share some
              interesting analysis with the subscribers to the list every now
              and then in the near future. Check it out at
              <strong><a href="http://www.patalyze.co">patalyze.co</a></strong
              >. There even is a small chart showing some data.
