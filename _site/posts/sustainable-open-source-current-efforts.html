              The recent appearance of
              <a href="http://clojuriststogether.org/">Clojurists Together</a>,
              friends working on
              <a href="https://openbounty.status.im/">OpenBounty</a>, as well as
              recently finding a lot of energy to work on a documentation
              platform for the Clojure ecosystem stirred some thoughts about
              sustainable OpenSource.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say one thing right out of the gate: sustainable OpenSource
              isn't really a goal on it's own. What the community (users as well
              as maintainers) strives for is reliability and well-maintained
              ecosystem components. Businesses and individuals alike depend on
              those properties — not the fact that work done to achieve them is
              sustainable. That said I don't see any ways to achieve those
              without sustainability.
            </p>
            <h3>Current Efforts</h3>
            <p>
              There are various platforms trying to improve sustainability of
              open source efforts that have continued momentum. Many of them
              with their own ideas how the situation can be improved.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://opencollective.com"
                  ><strong>OpenCollective</strong></a
                >
                collects payments fromindividuals and companies and stores funds
                for organizations. People may then&quot;invoice&quot; the
                organization. This can be for stickers and labor time alike.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://openbounty.status.im/"
                  ><strong>OpenBounty</strong></a
                >
                is a bounty platform usedwith cryptocurrencies. Contributors may
                work on specific issues and get paida bounty which has been
                defined in advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://clojuriststogether.org/"
                  ><strong>Clojurists Together</strong></a
                >
                collectsmoney from companies and community members to fund open
                sourceprojects benefitting the overall Clojure ecosystem. People
                may applywith a project they want to work on and get funding
                (depending onoverall availability) for a duration of three
                months.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All platforms take care of collecting money and have mechanisms
              for redistributing it. With OpenCollective a community will need
              to agree on processes to request and distribute funds. Clojurists
              Together collects money in similar ways to OpenCollective but has
              a predefined process for how funds are allocated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Projects like webpack
              <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack/expenses"
                >have embraced</a
              >
              OpenCollective with people getting reimbursed for expenses but
              also regular labor invoices for time worked on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenBounty also provides some of these processes by assigning
              bounties to specific tasks. OpenBounty is used in
              <a href="https://status.im/">Status.im</a>'s development process
              and while I don't believe bounties are the answer to everything
              I'm excited to watch this space in the future.
            </p>
            <h3>Sustainable Incentives</h3>
            <p>
              Contributing to OpenSource is about incentives. As far as I can
              judge these often are
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>fun &amp; community,</li>
              <li>fixing a problem one encountered,</li>
              <li>recognition &amp; better job opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Nothing is wrong with this list but they are not sustainable on
              their own. Just working for the fuzzy feeling of giving back to a
              community doesn't pay your bills. As soon as you can no longer
              afford to work for the fun of it the stability and momentum of
              projects you contributed to will suffer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe there are two kinds of participants required to achieve
              reliability, stability and so on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There need to be some people contributing on a regular basis.
                They provideoverall direction, deal with reported issues and
                incoming contributions.Often projects refer to this as
                &quot;core&quot;. In my experience stability of an opensource
                project suffers with fluctuations in the set of &quot;core&quot;
                people working on it.
              </li>
              <li>
                There need to be occasional/new contributors. Life will
                happen(kids, work, etc.) to regular contributors causing a
                naturaldecline. New contributors discovering they enjoy working
                on theproject can fill up those gaps.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In my opinion the incentives listed above are not sufficient —
              especially for long-term regular contributors. If work is unpaid
              it will eventually become stressful to juggle with other
              responsibilities and people will be forced to step back. New
              contributors are just as important and I believe there are
              improvements to be done there as well but ultimately nothing works
              without a &quot;core&quot; set of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have some further thoughts on how such incentives could be
              structured which I will explore in a later blog post.
