            <p>
              This summer a friend of mine is visiting Berlin for around 6 weeks
              by end of June. I encouraged him to work somewhere to get an
              impression of working in technology companies during that time.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is still quite young but eager to learn more than most other
              people I know. He's 17 from Krakow in Poland where he'll attend at
              <a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en"
                >AGH University of Science and Technology</a
              >
              studying Computer Science by October next year. He speaks German
              on a nearly native level (he got into several final rounds of
              nationwide language contests) and also English. Beside that he
              also reached the maximum score at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Kangaroo"
                >Mathematical Kangaroo</a
              >
              and won several other math olympiades.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a technical point of view he is mostly comfortable with
              Python and C++. He did not work a lot in any special area of
              software development so he might be unexperienced with the special
              limitations or technologies that are used in one area. He has some
              experience with web technologies (including Django) though.

              talent just send me a short note and I will introduce you gladly.
