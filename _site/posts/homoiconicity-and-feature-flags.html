              <p>
                At work we've been using feature flags to roll out various
                changes of the product. Most recently the rebrand from
                Icebreaker to <a href="https://gatheround.com">Gatheround</a>.
                This allowed us to continuously ship small pieces and review and
                improve these on their own pace without creating two vastly
                different branches of changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the rebrand work in particular there were lots of places
                where we needed relatively small, local differentiations between
                the old and the new appearance. Oftentimes just applying a
                different set of classes to a DOM element. Less often, up to
                swapping entire components.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall this approach seemed to work really well and we shipped
                the rebrand without significant delays and at a level of quality
                that made everyone happy. What we're left with now is some 250+
                conditionals involving our <code>use-new-brand?</code> feature
                flag.
              </p>
              <p><em>This tells the story of how we got rid of those.</em></p>
              <h2>Introducing Homoiconicity</h2>
              <p>
                If you're well familiar with homoiconicity this may not be
                entirely new but for those who aren't: homoiconicity is the
                fancy word for when you can read your program as data. Among
                many other lisp/scheme languages Clojure is homoiconic:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="clojure">(doseq [n (range 10)]
  (println n))
</code></pre>
              <p>
                The program above can be run but it can also be read as multiple
                nested lists:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="clojure">[doseq     [n [range 10]]    [println n]]
</code></pre>
              <p>
                Now, if you know what I'm talking about you will see that I
                skipped over a small detail here, namely that the code above
                uses two types of parenthesis and that information got lost in
                this simplified array representation.
              </p>
              <p>
                When doing it right (by differentiating between the two types of
                lists) we would end up with exactly the same representation as
                in the first code sample. And that is homoiconicity.
              </p>
              <h2>Homoiconicity &amp; Feature Flags</h2>
              <p>
                With this basic understanding of homoiconicity, lets take a look
                at what those feature flags looked like in practice:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="clojure">[:div
 {:class (if (config/use-new-brand?)
           &quot;bg-new-brand typo-body&quot;
           &quot;bg-old-brand typo-large&quot;)}]
</code></pre>
              <pre><code class="clojure">(when (config/use-new-brand?)
  (icon/Icon {:name &quot;conversation-color&quot;
              :class &quot;prxxs h3&quot;}))
</code></pre>
              <p>
                And so on. Now we have 250+ of those in our codebase but don't
                really plan on reversing that change any time soon... so we got
                to get rid of them. Fortunately Clojure is homoiconic and doing
                this is possible in a fashion that really tickles my brain in a
                nice way.
              </p>
              <h2>Code Rewriting</h2>
              <p>
                ... isn't new of course, CircleCI famously
                <a
                  href="https://circleci.com/blog/rewriting-your-test-suite-in-clojure-in-24-hours/"
                  >rewrote 14.000 lines of test code to use a new testing
                  framework</a
                >. I'm sure many others have done similar stuff and this general
                idea also isn't limited to Clojure. Code rewriting tools exist
                in many language ecosystems.
                <strong
                  >But how easily you can do it in Clojure felt very
                  empowering.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The next two sections will be about some 30 lines of code that
                got us there about 90% of the way.
              </p>
              <h2>Babashka + rewrite-clj</h2>
              <p>
                <a href="https://babashka.org/">Babashka</a> is a &quot;fast,
                native Clojure scripting runtime&quot;. With Babashka you can
                work with the filesystem with shell-like abstractions, make http
                requests and much more. You can't use every Clojure library from
                Babashka but many useful ones are included right out of the box.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the libraries that is included is
                <a href="https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj"
                  >rewrite-clj</a
                >. And, you guessed it, rewrite-clj helps you 🥁 ... rewrite
                Clojure/Script code.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hadn't used rewrite-clj before much am still a bit unfamiliar
                with it's API but after asking some questions on Slack
                <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude">@borkdude</a> (who also
                created Babashka) helped me out with an example of transforming
                conditionals that I then adapted for my specific situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will not go into the code in detail here but if you're
                interested, I recorded
                <a
                  href="https://www.loom.com/share/70c1d3c45d9f45e9833344b5bd076813"
                  >a short 4 minute video explaining it at a surface level and
                  demonstrating my workflow</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rewriting logic showed in the video ignores many edge cases
                and isn't an attempt at an holistic tool to remove dead code
                branches but in our case this basic tool removed about 95% of
                the feature flag usages, leaving a mere 12 cases behind that
                used things like <code>cond-&gt;</code> or conjunctions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of the more than 230 feature flags that have been removed only
                about ten needed additional adjustments for indentation. This
                happened mostly when a feature-flag-using conditional wrapped
                multiple lines of code. Due to the locality of our changes that
                (fortunately) was relatively uncommon. If we had set up an
                automatic formatter for our code this also wouldn't have
                required any extra work.
              </p>
              <h2>Onward</h2>
              <p>
                This has been an extremely satisfying project, if you can even
                call those 30 lines a &quot;project&quot;. I hope you also
                learned something or found it helpful in other ways!
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to

                for all his work on Babashka. The interactive development

                paired with blazing startup times and a rich ecosystem makes it
                feel like there is a lot of potential still to be uncovered.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd also like to thank
                <a href="https://github.com/lread">Lee Read</a>, who has done
                such an amazing job making rewrite-clj ready for more platforms
                like ClojureScript and Babashka as well as making sure it's
                future-proof by adding more tests and fixing many long standing
                bugs.
