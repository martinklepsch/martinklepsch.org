            Emacs & Vim

            <p>
              After using Vim for more than four years my recent contacts with
              Lisp encouraged me to take another look at Emacs. I used to make
              jokes about Emacs just as Emacs users about Vim but actually it
              seems to be a pretty decent piece of software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a Vim user in the Clojure community sometimes feels weird.
              You are happy with Vim. Running Clojure code with right from the
              editor works well these days. Still you wonder why all those
              people you consider smart seem to be so committed to Emacs. So I
              decided to try it once again.
            </p>
            <h2>Keybindings</h2>
            <p>
              Let's start with a slight rant: I completely do not understand how
              anyone can use Emacs' default keybindings. Being a Vim user I
              obviously have a thing for mode-based editing but Emacs'
              keybindings are beyond my understanding. Some simple movement
              commands to illustrate this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Move cursor down one line
                <ul>
                  <li>Emacs: <code>Ctrl-n</code></li>
                  <li>Vim: <code>j</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Move cursor up one line
                <ul>
                  <li>Emacs: <code>Ctrl-p</code></li>
                  <li>Vim: <code>k</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Move cursor left one character
                <ul>
                  <li>Emacs: <code>Ctrl-b</code></li>
                  <li>Vim: <code>h</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Move cursor right one character
                <ul>
                  <li>Emacs: <code>Ctrl-f</code></li>
                  <li>Vim: <code>l</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These are the commands recommended in the Emacs tutorial (which
              you open with <code>Ctrl-h t</code>). They are mnemonic, what
              makes them easy to learn–but is that really the most important
              factor to consider for commands you will use hundreds of times a
              day? I don't think so. I tried to convince myself that it might be
              worth to get used to Emacs' default keybindings but after some
              time I gave up and installed <code>evil-mode</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>Mode-based Editing with Evil Mode</h2>
            <p>
              In my memory <code>evil-mode</code> sucked. I was delightfully
              surprised that it doesn't (anymore?). Evil brings well-done mode
              based editing to Emacs. As you continue to evolve your Emacs
              configuration you will most likely install additional packages
              that bring weird Emacs-style keybindings with them. Since you now
              have a mode-based editor you can use shorter, easier to remember
              keybindings to call functions provided by these packages. A useful
              helper that fits a sweet spot in my Vim-brain is
              <code>evil-leader</code> which allows you to setup
              <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> based keybindings, just like you can
              do it in Vim:
            </p>
            <pre><code>(evil-leader/set-leader &quot;,&quot;)
(evil-leader/set-key
  &quot;,&quot; 'projectile-find-file)</code></pre>
            <p>
              With this I can open a small panel that finds files in my project
              in a fuzzy way (think Ctrl-p for Vim) hitting <code>,</code> two
              times instead of <code>Ctrl-c p f</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>Batteries Included</h2>
            <p>
              What I really enjoyed with Emacs was the fact that a package
              manager comes right with it. After adding a community maintained
              package repository to your configuration you have access to some
              2000 packages covering Git integration, syntax and spell checking,
              interactive execution of Clojure code and more. This has been
              added in a the last major update (<code>v24</code>) after being a
              community project for some years.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Vim's lack of support for async execution of code has always
              bugged me and although there are some projects to change this I
              can't see it being properly fixed at least until NeoVim becomes
              the go-to Vim implementation. Emacs allows me to kick off commands
              and do other things until they return. In addition to that it
              nicely embeds Vim's most notable idea, mode-based editing, very
              well, allowing me to productively edit text while having a solid
              base to extend and to interactively write programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are interested in seeing how all that comes together in my
              Emacs configuration you can find it
