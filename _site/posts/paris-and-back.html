              After being back home from Paris where I stayed the last two weeks
              I have a fun story to share. It's not about something great that
              happened in Paris but about something that started the evening
              before my departure.
            </p>
            <p>
              After meeting with a friend there we got home at 2am and set up
              the alarm to 4:35am to get up in time, get some work done and get
              to the airport sometime around 6.20am. When I opened my eyes I
              immediately noticed that there was no alarm ringing. That made me
              jump for the alarm clock. It was 7.15am. I started to hate myself.
              I even asked my friend to pinch me so that this nightmare ends.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>This was the second flight for me ever and I missed it.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              We went to the trainstation then and asked about a train. 125€ and
              an 8 hours trainride. Since that was a nighttrain we decided to go
              to the airport and check out if there are some cheap flights which
              I could book — <em>last minute</em>. There was a flight. It was
              not cheap with a 182€ pricetag though. Given the fact that I payed
              100€ for the original flights I was completely pissed. After a
              couple of minutes I decided to take the flight for 182€ and we
              even made a little fun about what it costs to sleep in.
              Nevertheless I still hated myself for not being able to get up in
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now this is already a story worth telling but it had to come
              better.
            </p>
            <p>
              When waiting to board the plane things got delayed because the
              plane was struck by lightning and the ground crew had to do extra
              technical checks. After some time they announced that they found
              another plane and that boarding will start in 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to walk around a little and when I came back the flight
              assistant was asking some people sitting on the ground something I
              could not understand. So I asked one french girl who was sitting
              there what she asked. And here it comes. She asked if you would
              take a later flight in exchange for 250€. When I heard that I
              immediately ran to the flight assistant and told her:
              <em>&quot;I'm in!&quot;</em> and so I got 250€.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a small bonus we even got a voucher for a restaurant at the
              airport where I another french girl and one american guy spent our
              2 hours extra waiting time eating some good meat and french fries.
            </p>
            <p><em>I felt so incredibly lucky.</em></p>
            <p>Before we got to the airport I told my friend:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Oh, and that happens to me. Usually I am so lucky.</p>
            </blockquote>
