              Earlier this year I came to the “very” surprising conclusion that
              I'm not doing enough sports in relation to the hours I spend in
              front of a computer every day.
              <a href="/2013/03/10/From-Zero-To-Marathon-In-Six-Months/"
                >I decided to run a marathon this September</a
              >. I didn't. I did something else though that was fun and kind of
              sporty as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              After starting runnning in March it was pretty amazing to see how
              quickly your stamina improves and longer distances become easier
              and less painful to run. After that initial success though
              improvements got smaller and motivation tanked quickly. Also the
              marathon I wanted to run was already booked out apparently.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>March</strong> 60.3km</li>
              <li><strong>April</strong> 33.5km</li>
              <li><strong>May</strong> 18.3km</li>
              <li><strong>June</strong> 5.5km</li>
              <li><strong>July</strong> 5.1km</li>
              <li><strong>August</strong> 0.0km</li>
              <li><strong>September</strong> 20km</li>
              <li><strong>October</strong> 4.8km</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              From a friend who also inspired me to go running I heard about
              <strong>Tough Mudder</strong>. Since I already noticed my lack of
              a goal I almost immediately registered in the beginning of June.
              The description on Wikipedia sounded exciting for sure:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>Tough Mudder</strong> is an endurance event series in
                which participants attempt 10-12 mile long military-style
                obstacle courses. Designed by British Special Forces to test
                mental as well as physical strength, obstacles often play on
                common human fears, such as fire, water, electricity and
                heights.

            <h2><strike>Preparation</strike></h2>
            <p>
              After seeing the (surprisingly) fast improvements when training I
              was certain I could get ready for a 20km run in a month or less.
              So I decided to start training a month before the event on 19th
              October:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>01.06 - 23.09</strong> 0.0km</li>
              <li><strong>24.09</strong> 5.7km</li>
              <li><strong>28.09</strong> 9km</li>
              <li><strong>30.09</strong> 6.3km</li>
              <li><strong>06.10</strong> 4.8km</li>
              <li><strong>19.10</strong> Tough Mudder</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Somehow I wasn't quite persistent and stopped shortly after
              starting again. I guess mostly because it was such a pain to build
              up stamina <strong>again</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2>Oh Shit! It's tomorrow!</h2>
            <p>
              The days immediately before the event were full of uncertainty and
              doubt whether I could make it or not. 20km without any training?
              Is that even remotely possible? I never ran 20km before. Sometimes
              excuses not to go popped up in my mind but the hefty price tag of
              around 100€ and the social pressure of running in a group didn't
              really leave the option of not going.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Surprisingly it was possible</strong>. The around 15
              obstacles usually took some time to pass and equally gave some to
              rest. The hardest part (stamina-wise) was a 2-4km trail up and
              down a hill over and over again. The whole course took us around 3
              hours to complete.<br />
              We got a bit dirty on the way. I say <strong>we</strong> because
              completing the course on your own is almost impossible and we
              certainly have been a great team:
