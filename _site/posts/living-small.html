              Living in a world where consumerism appears to be the predominant
              behaviour it seems more and more exciting to me to live a less
              materialistic lifestyle. What follows are some of the things that
              stimulated my thinking — maybe they do the same for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              After stumbling upon Bruce Hauman’s blog while trying to figure
              out some Clojure stuff I discovered another post on his blog where
              he talks about
              <a
                href="http://rigsomelight.com/2013/09/09/frameless-geodesic-dome.html"
                >building a geodesic dome</a
              >
              in which he’s now (partly?) living for 3.5 years. It’s an
              amazingly analytical post about building something and simplifying
              it to it’s purest, most functional form. Motivated by spending
              less money on rent he iterated on his idea resulting in this
              construction:
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/dome-cropped.jpg" />
              <figcaption>
                In case you were wondering what this “geodesic dome” thing looks
                like
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              In his post he also mentions the
              <a href="http://thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/"
                >Tiny Housing Movement</a
              >
              through which I found a TED talk that nicely illustrates the
              pitfalls of the idea of living “a good life” once you have your
              own income. The key line in the talk is:
              <strong>What does freedom mean to you?</strong> I wanted to give a
              small summary here but, as it is with TED talks,
              <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XRPbFIN4lk"
                >the talk itself</a
              >
              does it’s job pretty well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe as thoughtful members of our society we should
              <strong>rethink our relationship to stuff</strong>. How can we, as
              a society, make better use of the things we have at our disposal?
              What do I really need to <strong>own</strong> to live my life?
              Ideas like
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy"
                >the share economy</a
              >
              seem like a logical step with the increasing ease of
              sharing/routing information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purposely living with less is obviously not a new idea and so it
              happens to be part of things like
              <a
                href="http://zenhabits.net/minimalist-fun-the-100-things-challenge/"
                >the 100 Things Challenge</a
              >. Coming across the 100 Things Challenge again and again I want
              to try it myself. In February I'm going to create an inventory of
              the things I own. Let’s see if the number of things I own is going
              to be above or below 100.

                Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it
                haven't changed correspondingly. We overvalue stuff.
