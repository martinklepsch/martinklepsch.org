            <p>
              I've been working remotely for a bit over a year now. Most
              projects went pretty well. Some not so much. I've worked with
              fully distributed teams and as a satellite worker with on-site
              teams. I'm not an expert—but I've learned some things.
            </p>
            <p>
              What follows are some basic ideas to make remote teams work. I
              hope these help companies and remote workers set things up for
              success.
            </p>
            <h3>Focus on Self Sufficiency</h3>
            <p>
              In an office you walk up to somebody (read: interrupt their work)
              and discuss stuff. In a remote environment you may need to
              schedule, then wait, then deal with connectivity issues, then have
              a discussion. Sometimes the waiting part alone can take the better
              part of a day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Synchronous communication, including chat, is great and necessary
              but the more your work routine relies on it, the more you might
              unknowingly slow everyone down.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that in mind, start thinking of communication as a cost
              factor. Being slowed down costs time, momentum and motivation.
              These are the things you usually want to preserve at all cost. And
              that's where self-sufficiency comes in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being self sufficient in work means knowing what to do in order to
              advance the project and having the means to execute. The easiest
              way to make people understand what is worth working on is making
              them understand the business. Sometimes more specific goals will
              also do the job. But generally the broader the better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once everyone is able to develop ideas based on their
              understanding of the business all that is missing is The Feedback
              Loop™. Feedback is often a critical part of UI design but that
              does not mean it isn't applicable to other domains. Enable your
              team to see the impact of their work. Define relevant metrics and
              measure, measure, measure, graph, graph, graph. Share and
              celebrate accomplishments.
            </p>
            <h3>Document With Rigour</h3>
            <p>
              Again, communication has a cost. It's fun and important too. You
              want to spend that valuable face-time with your colleagues
              chatting about last weekends hike or that tricky problem you're
              banging your head against. You don't want to spend it figuring out
              how to run migrations or update your environment so that things
              work again with those latest changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have a <code>README</code>. Make sure to add a table of contents.
              This is reference material, not an essay. Maybe try Asciidoc if
              Markdown feels too restrictive. Ensure that pull requests are
              reviewed with documentation changes in mind. With GitHub's pull
              request templates it's easy to remind team members to update
              documentation.
            </p>
            <p>That hike last week was nice by the way:</p>

            <div class="pa2 tc f3 blue">· · ·</div>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I realize the up-front cost of making someone understand the
              intricacies of a business might be higher than just telling them
              to &quot;do this&quot;. There may be smaller projects where deep
              understanding is not necessary. It seems reasonable to think that
              everyone does a better job if they do understand the business
              though.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now all these suggestions are probably applicable to any team, not
              only remote ones. However they are of particular importance for
              remote teams.
            </p>

              Distributed teams face special challenges.

                >I would love to hear yours</a

              and see if there might be something that could be built to help.
