After not being active here for the last couple of months I thought a bit about
what to do with this blog and came up with some changes and ideas.

1. **More regular updates and smaller linked-list style posts.** Writing full
   length posts about more complex topics is nice but not something I can do
   regulary right now. Still there are often things I find and would like to
   share. I also hope that this gets me more used to “regular publishing” and
   thus increases the frequency of more in-depth posts.
2. **A newsletter.** There will be a (most likely digest-style)
   newsletter in irregular intervals depending on the frequency of updates.<br>
   **Why a newsletter?** This is most likely a topic for a seperate post but
   with the advent of platforms like Medium, Twitter and friends it's common not to “own
   the connection” between a publisher and a writer anymore and I believe that
   this is wrong. There is RSS but it's only a one way channel and I'd actually like to
   get to know the people reading the stuff I'm posting here. Also not everyone
   has an RSS reader set up. There is a subscribe form at the end of each post
   and on [the index page](/).
3. **Some design changes.** To keep that one short: less wierd “about me”
   bullshit, more content. Also: [rainbow](javascript:;) [colors](javascript:;)
   [everywhere](javascript:;)!

I already have a couple of things queued up to be published including one more
lengthy post about how I'd attempt to set up a company if I'd have to do it now (everyone knows better, right?)
If you have thoughts on this [I'd appreciate any input](mailto://martinklepsch@googlemail.com)
on the draft I have laying around.
