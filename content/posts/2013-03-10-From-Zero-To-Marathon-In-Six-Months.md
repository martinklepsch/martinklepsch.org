After moving to Berlin I kind of failed to continue some regular sports activity.
This is two years ago now. Today I'm going to change that.

Today I'm starting to run.

## Why Running

The answer is as simple as it gets: because it can be done everywhere at any time and without
any organizational effort such as finding a partner for going climbing, which I did back
then in my old hometown.

## Running a Marathon

To stay motivated in the long term I decided it would be nice to set some goal to achieve
and what else could that be beside running a marathon? There is not much coming to my mind.
So starting today I'm training to run a marathon in about six months. I don't know which
marathon yet unfortunately, especially since the [Berlin marathon](http://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/)&rsquo;s registration is closed already.

My training schedule isn&rsquo;t finished yet but for the first month I&rsquo;m planning to
run at least [3 days a week](http://www.runmap.net/route/437129) at an average distance
of six kilometers.  I hope to run longer distances irregularly as soon as possible as
well.

Today is Day One.
