*Startups, This Is How Design Works* is an excellent read for every designer and those
who want to be one. It builds up around a definition of good design by Dieter Rams, an early consumer
product designer at Braun which inspired Apple in many of their fundamental design choices.

The web is definitly missing more high quality resources like this.
It just takes people to much time to realize that design is not about photoshop brushes.
