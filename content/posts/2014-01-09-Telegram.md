[Telegram](https://telegram.org) is a new messenger built by Pavel and Nikolai
Durov.  They previously founded vk.com, Europe's second largest social network
after Facebook (especially popular in Russia).

## A Few Reasons Why It's Great

1. Unlike most other messaging apps their [clients (Android, iOS) source code and the underlying protocols are released with an open source license](https://telegram.org/source) (GPL v2)
2. The founders note that they have no intention of [making money with Telegram](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this) If they ever run out of money they want to finance it with donations and non-essential goodies.
3. There is an [API](https://core.telegram.org/api) that allows anyone to hook
   into Telegram and build clients, bots and additional tools.
4. The open API has led to the creation of 
   [Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/messenger-for-telegram/id747648890),
   [Windows](http://tdesktop.com/) and various other clients
   (eg. [commandline](https://github.com/vysheng/tg)) that allow you to use Telegram
   on multiple devices (with proper syncing).
5. Groups can hold up to 200 users (compared to WhatsApp that allows you to
   create 50 groups à 50 participants max.)
6. All communication in Telegram [is encrypted](https://telegram.org/faq#security) and there is even an option to
   create “[secret chats](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats)” that: won’t be
   stored on Telegram’s servers, can’t be fowarded and will delete themself after some
   time.

Currently available for
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger),
[Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/messenger-for-telegram/id747648890)
& [Windows](http://tdesktop.com) there is really no reason not to make the
switch.

**Send me a message how you like it:** <a href="tel:+4917664718250">+49176 64718250</a>.  
(It’s easy: just tap the number on your phone, save me as contact and I’ll appear
in your Telegram contacts.)

**Edit:** Although it's not a completely decentralized service (as communication services
should eventually be in the future) it seems to be a big step in the right direction.
