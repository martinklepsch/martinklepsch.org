Back when I lived at home my dad used to make fun of my mechanical skills.
He said if everyone just sits in front of computers the whole day no one will
know how to drill a hole at some point. He would like what follows.

[Woodworking Masterclasses](http://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/) is an online
course to woodworking. It's the first time that I've seen such high quality
material about learning a craft. They offer a simple monthly subscription to
their courses with a new video being released every week. The videos are
**top-notch**. Kind of like you would expect it by a company like
Treehouse but not by people who do woodworking and are probably not too
familiar with cutting videos and this type of stuff. Take a look:

I like how the internet supports the ongoing evolvement of crafts and
woodworking has always fascinated me. These videos make me want to be at
a farm with a huge workbench.
