In order to write more I'm going to embark on a little project: publishing 100 pieces of writing. This is inspired by a bunch of Twitter strangers putting things like "(22/100 Youtube videos)" after their display names and by [Mike](https://critter.blog/) who's been blogging every day for the last 100+ days, producing a wonderful array of short but insightful articles.

Doing anything a hundred times should give me a good understanding of what I like or dislike about it. It'll also require that I keep an open eye for topics and themes to write about. Being a more attentive observer. Reviewing notes and bookmarks on the hunt for the next bit. 

I'd love my writing to be unapologetic and opinionated. This is what I like about writers like [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) and [Visakan](https://twitter.com/visakanv). 

If there's things you'd like to see me write about, let me know!
