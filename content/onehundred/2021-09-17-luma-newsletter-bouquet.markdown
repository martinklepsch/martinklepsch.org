title: Luma Newsletter No. 1
type: onehundred
---

I'm not really sure why but in the spirit of exploration I started a kind of irregular newsletter. You can read [the first edition here](https://lu.ma/p/MnWMR5rLJHDcWL5/Martin-says-Welcome).

Since I started this project here of writing 100 things I decided to be generous with myself and I'll also count any newsletters I'm sending.
