title: Deep frozen pizza
---
Every now and then I'd order pizza. Maybe it's Sunday, the fridge is empty and you're not really feeling like Sushi or Indian. You're craving the carbs of a nice pizza. Unfortunately almost all the time I'd be disappointed by my decision. Pizza that is in a delivery box for anything between 10-30 minutes just can't be the same as one that's fresh out of the oven. You all know what I'm talking about. 

So, the thoughtleader that I am, I hereby proclaim that you shall not order pizza but instead buy frozen pizza. In particular the ones by [Gustavo Gusto](https://gustavo-gusto.de/pizzen/). They are gooood. üçï
