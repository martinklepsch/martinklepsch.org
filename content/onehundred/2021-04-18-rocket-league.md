I've you've talked to me about computer/console games I've probably mentioned Rocket League. 

Gaming has been kind of an on-and-off hobby for me since my youth. Sometimes I just didn't have access to a computer that would allow me to play games. Yes, those were the days when I was using Linux. A Mac isn't much better though so I eventually bought a Playstation 4 a few years ago. I played many games I liked but one that I'm still playing on a somewhat regular basis is Rocket League. 

I first played what was to become Rocket League on a Playstation 3. Then it was called *Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars*. It's essentially soccer with 1-3 rocket powered cars per team. To me it's the perfect adaptation of an old idea (‚öΩÔ∏è) to a new medium, online multiplayer games. It can be highly cooperative if you're not playing 1v1 and even if the game mechanics aren't very complex the skill ceiling is high.

I have a few friends who I play with every now and then, we log into Discord and on a good day we'll let each other know where we are on the field, when we're going for the ball etc. On a bad day we bump into each other. üòÖ

With one game lasting between 5-8 minutes it can be a nice break-time activity. It's also nice that you can play it cross-platform (Playstation, Xbox, Windows). Anyways, this is my Rocket League appreciation post üòÅ Hit me up if you want to play some time!
