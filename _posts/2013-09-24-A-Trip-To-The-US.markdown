Wow. It has been quite a while since I wrote anything here. Almost 5 months, phew.

So what I have to say is that I'm going to visit the US from **26th
of October** to **10th of November**. I plan to be in New York City the first
weekend, spend some time around Philadelphia within the week after that and
then go to Miami for another week.

I'd love to meet some interesting people, have some beers, crash some parties.
So if you have some friends I should meet, let me know!

Also me and the friend I'm visiting (who's from Philadelphia) are looking for
a couch to crash.

Cheers to that — It's gonna be fun!
