When O'Reilly promoted their cyber monday I somehow really got into a shopping
spree.

First book I finished now is [Code
Simplicity](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do) by [Max Kanat
Alexander](http://max.kanat-alexander.com/).  The book doesn't hold on to the
scientific approach that the blurb promises but once I made my peace with that
it became a good read.   
Some of the things I liked most:

- It provides good reasoning why an iterative process usually provides better
  results than the old *Plan & Implement* workflow.
- It has a strong argumentation for testing that can help you the next time
  you have to explain why it is important or understand it yourself if you didn't
  so far.
- It gives you some great new angles on how to prioritize features.

Overall I'd probably recommend the book but you shouldn't expect to much
scientific proof. Probably that's not even possible in that area but the
blurb said so and that caused
[some](https://readmill.com/christoffer/reads/code-simplicity)
[bad](https://readmill.com/chdorner/reads/code-simplicity) reviews so take it
with a grain of salt.
