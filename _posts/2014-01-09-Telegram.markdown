title: Sending You a Telegram
---
[Telegram](https://telegram.org) is a new messenger built by Pavel and Nikolai
Durov.  They previously founded vk.com, Europe's second largest social network
after Facebook (especially popular in Russia).

## A Few Reasons Why It's Great

1. Unlike most other messaging apps their [clients (Android, iOS) source code and the
   underlying protocols are released with an open source
   license](https://telegram.org/source) (GPL v2)
2. The founders note that they have no intention of [making money with
   Telegram](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this) 
   If they ever run out of money they want to finance it with donations and
   non-essential goodies.
3. There is an [API](https://core.telegram.org/api) that allows anyone to hook
   into Telegram and build clients, bots and additional tools.
4. The open API has led to the creation of 
   [Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/messenger-for-telegram/id747648890) and
   [Windows](http://tdesktop.com/) clients that allow you to use Telegram on
   multiple devices (with proper syncing).
5. Groups can hold up to 200 users (compared to WhatsApp that allows you to
   create 50 groups à 50 participants max.)

Currently available for
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger),
[Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/messenger-for-telegram/id747648890)
& [Windows](http://tdesktop.com) there is really no reason not to make the
switch.

**Send me a message how you like it:** <a href="tel:+4917664718250">+49176 64718250</a>

**Edit:** Although it's not a completely decentralized service (as communication services
should eventually be in the future) it seems to be a big step in the right direction.
