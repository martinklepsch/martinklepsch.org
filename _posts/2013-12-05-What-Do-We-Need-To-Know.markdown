This post on A List Apart resonated with me a lot. [Liza Danger Gardner](https://twitter.com/lyzadanger)
describes a situation we all have been in: someone talks about that *new feature
you never heard of* and you have no idea what they are talking about. Web
development being a profession that develops so fast and in so many directions
at the same time <strike>sometimes</strike> makes it hard to follow along.

She then attempts to answer this question by answering the opposite question “What do we
not need to know?” which is fine but doesn't exactly provide you with a list of
things that are *required*. Probably this list is hard to create but I'm curious
what you would put on it. What are the high level concepts in web development
everyone should know about? Is it “How the DOM works” or is it “What Prototypes are in Javascript”
or is it ...?

I'd love to hear what you think is “required knowledge” on Twitter ([@martinklepsch](https://twitter.com/martinklepsch))
or elsewhere.
