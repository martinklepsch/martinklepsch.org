This summer a friend of mine is visiting Berlin for around 6 weeks by end of June. I encouraged him to work somewhere to get an impression of working in technology companies during that time.

He is still quite young but eager to learn more than most other people I know.  He's 17 from
Krakow in Poland where he'll attend at [AGH University of Science and Technology](http://www.agh.edu.pl/en) 
studying Computer Science by October next year. He
speaks German on a nearly native level (he got into several final rounds of nationwide
language contests) and also English.
Beside that he also reached the maximum score at
[Mathematical Kangaroo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Kangaroo) and won several
other math olympiades.

From a technical point of view he is mostly comfortable with Python and C++. He did not work
a lot in any special area of software development so he might be unexperienced with the
special limitations or technologies that are used in one area. He has some experience with
web technologies (including Django) though.

If you'd like to get in touch and to get to know some great new talent just send me a short
note and I will introduce you gladly.
