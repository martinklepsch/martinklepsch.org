I just discovered [Kandan](http://kandan.me) which seems to be a great opensource alternative to
[Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) (a web-based team chat application).
The interface is pretty similar and the developers
probably borrowed a few of the interface ideas behind campfire.

Some time ago there was also [Grove.io](https://grove.io/) which advertises itself as
"hosted IRC". The web interface they provide also provides some of Campfires more pupular
features such as image embedding. Unfortunately they went into a paid-only model which makes
it less attractive to many people.

Hopefully Kandan evolves into something bigger and team chat in companies is no longer
limited to just Campfire or worse Skype.
