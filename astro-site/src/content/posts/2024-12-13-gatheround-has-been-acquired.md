When I joined [Gatheround](https://gatheround.com/) I had a clear vision that for my next job *I wanted to be part of a team again.* To share the ups and downs, work more closely with product and design folks and to learn more about building software products.

The years of consulting, albeit full of variety, left me longing for depth.

Thanks to a friend I got introduced to and ended up joining Lisa, Perry and Alexander on their quest to build a digital product to foster human connection.

And while I'm no longer working at Gatheround **this somehow still feels like a milestone worth sharing**: Gatheround [has been acquired by Donut](https://www.donut.com/blog/donut-acquires-gatheround/)!

**Community building has always been close to my heart**; be it within the Clojure community or my extended group of friends in Berlin.

From their roots in grassroots activisim we had some hypothesis to test around human connection in online spaces. And when COVID hit, the proverbial fans started spinning. The need for connection was greater than ever and Gatheround helped organizations, communities and companies to keep things human with smart breakout matching and fun-to-serious conversation prompts.

With promising traction [we raised a Series A from Homebrew](https://homebrew.co/blog/2023/11/06/gatheround-raises-usd8-million-series-a-for-software-that-powers-high-impact-video-meetings), Slack Fund and others. We also shifted focus towards more business use cases like all-hands meetings, onboarding sessions and other experiences.

While I left earlier in 2024 to pursue other projects it's been a fascinating experience to be a part of Gatheround's evolution over the years.

Here's to its future ðŸ¥‚
