I recently discovered this great presentation by checking out some of my follow-recommendations on
twitter. [Wilson Miner](https://twitter.com/wilsonminer) was one of them.
This talk adresses everyone who builds software and makes some of the broader side-effects
of designing things other people use more visible.

The presentation itself is more a piece of acting than a usual talk.
I enjoyed the variety so I hope you will too.
