The other day a new colleague joined the team at Icebreaker and he started doing something that I always liked as a fun norm of sorts but never really quite stuck with me as something I would do: posting GIFs alongside PR reviews.

Inspired by the Family Guy "CSS Window Blinds" classic I quickly found this super easy [GIFs for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gifs-for-github/dkgjnpbipbdaoaadbdhpiokaemhlphep) Chrome extension. It integrates Giphy's search into GitHub comment forms and makes it a breeze to sprinkle whatever feedback you may have with something that might make your colleagues smile.

I guess the next level is maintaining your own repository of GIFs and having them ready at the blink of an eye. Like back in the golden days of IRC.
