In order to write more I'm going to embark on a little project: publishing 100 pieces of writing. This is inspired by a bunch of Twitter strangers putting things like "(22/100 Youtube videos)" next to their display names and by [Mike](https://critter.blog/) who has been blogging every day for the last 100+ days, producing a wonderful array of short but insightful articles.

Doing anything a hundred times should give me a good understanding of what I like or dislike about it. It'll also require that I keep an open eye for topics and themes to write about. Being a more attentive observer. Reviewing notes and bookmarks on the hunt for the next bit. 

I've also observed that a lot of writing I enjoy has a certain conviction to it. Writers like [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) and [Visakan](https://twitter.com/visakanv) come to mind. They share their ideas without much introduction or "proof", and yet a lot of their writing really resonates with me as being true to my subjective experience. 

In the process of writing more regularly I will also write shorter posts, share more unfinished ideas, mid-flight thoughts and random ramblings. Part of this experiment is to get rid of the filter I've created for myself for posting on my [main blog](https://martinklepsch.org) and just write more for the sake of writing â€” and sharing. 

If there's things you'd like to see me write about, let me know!
